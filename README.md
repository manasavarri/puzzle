***DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE GAME***

The Alphanumeric Adventure!" is an exciting and challenging treasure hunt game that challenges players to unlock a locked box by solving clues and cracking alphanumeric codes. Players embark on an adventure to find the treasure hidden within the box, and they must use their wit, observation skills, and problem-solving abilities to decipher the clues and unlock the key.
  
***Gameplay:***
Upon logging in as the admin, the player is presented with a locked hunt chest and five blank boxes to enter the alphanumeric code. The player has a time limit of 5 minutes to crack the code and unlock the hunt chest. Below each blank box, there is a hint symbol that the player can click to reveal a clue.

The clues provided are designed to challenge the player's problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities. The clues may be in the form of riddles, puzzles, wordplay, or visual cues that require careful observation and deduction to decipher the alphanumeric code.

The player can attempt to enter the alphanumeric code in any order they prefer, and they can click on the hint symbols to reveal the clues. If the player enters an incorrect code, the hunt chest remains locked, and they can try again.

If the player successfully enters the correct alphanumeric code in all five blank boxes within the 5-minute time limit, the hunt chest unlocks, and the player wins the game. As a reward, the player receives 100 gold coins and may proceed to the next level if available.
  
  With a limited time schedule and a single user admin account, the game is suitable for small-scale or personal use. Players can enjoy the excitement of solving clues and cracking the code to unlock the hunt chest and claim the treasure, all within the confines of the single level of the game.
